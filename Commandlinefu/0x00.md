  - strace is a utility that traces system calls and signals
  - To save it to a file
     - `strace -o output ls /tmp/`
  - `-c` gives you a tabular description of all the system call
  - It is also interesting to note that strace shows information about system calls. Those functions must not be mistaken with the standard C library functions. Syscalls are one of the kernel interfaces available to user processes. For example, since malloc is not a syscall but a standard C library function you will not see those calls in straceâ€™s output.
