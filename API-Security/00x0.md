### [Common REST API security pitfalls by Philippe De Ryck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Meh4EUmLCfM)

 - Allowing API's over HTTP
 - JWT Tokes
	 - Signing can be done in two ways : Shared Secret, Public/private key pair. 
		 - Sign with private key, verify the signature with public key
	 - Defending against CSRF in API's
		 - Transparent cookies.
			 - Server sends two cookies instead of one, one CSRF token in cookie , then cookie value is copied to header, as header can not be set by any other domain then the origin, server will reject the request.
