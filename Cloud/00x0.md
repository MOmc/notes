# AWS Security Fundamentals

### Overview

 - AWS Security Checklist [link](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Auditing_Security_Checklist.pdf)
 - AWS Security is differnt from Enterprise Security
 - TEST DEV PRODUCTION
 - DEVLOPER SECURITY-ENGINEER COMPLIANCE-OFFICER
 - AWS also provide infrastructure compliance 
	 - ISO 27001
	 - SOC
	 - PCI Data Security
	 - FedRamp
	 - But AWS Complaint doesn't mean you are compliant
 - Shared Responsibility
	 - AWS provide Secure compute Layer
		 - Everything from Network,Storage, DB, VM
		 - Physical Data Centers Local, Availabilty
	 - Customer Responsibility
		 - Client Side Data Encryption
		 - Server Side Encryption
		 - Data Integrity
		 - Network Traffic Protection
		 - OS, Firewall Configuration
		 - IAM
		 - Customer Data
 - Governance
	 - Who - can access the Data Center, AWS Instance, Has the keys
	 - What - Data
	 - When - Time
	 - Where - Location
 - Network Configuration
	 - AWS uses Network isolation using Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
 - Asset Congiguration Management
	 - AWS manages the physical infrastructre.
	 - We are responsible for configuration and patch management VM Settings and OS.
	 - AWS control panel and IAM has the tools to control policy
	 - Logical Access Control
		 - Remote Access
			 - VPN
			 - Direct Connect
			 - Security Groups
		 - IAM
 - Data Encryption
	 - If a country ask to handover phyical data they have to be compliant to it.
	 - Data at rest
		 - S3 object supports Encryption
			 - But you don't have to give keys to the govt. ;)
		 - Data in motion
			 - VPN
			 - HTTPS
			 - SSL
 - Security Logging & Monitoring (Compliance)
	 - If breach happens we should have who and when access to sys was happen.
 
 - Disaster Recovery
	 - Replication is available
 
### Access Control
- IAM - All Control
- Assigning Rights
- Creating Users
	- But first we create groups
	- (Groups(rigts(users)))
- Comparable to AD
- API Calls
- S3 instances
- DATABase Control
- We can assign policy to user or to group
- Almost 200 policies
	- AdminstratorAccess
	- EC2 full Access
- Identity providers are like AD
- Account Settings
	- Password strenfth
	- password Validity
- Creating a User
	- Policies
		- EFFECT
		- ACTION
		- RESOURCE
	- Ask for Progamattic login , password login
		- Download the Access key and Secret key.
- `pip install awscli`
- Create a group using aws cli
	- Best practice is to create an account other than root.
	- `aws configure` add Access and Secret key.
	- `aws iam create-group --group-name Auditors`
	- `aws iam create-user --user-name Larry`
- Logging as another user
 
### Encrypting & Controlling Access to S3
 - Server Side Encryption
	 - KMS  [SSE-KMS]
		 - hidden from customer 
		 - IAM used it
	 - AWS Managed Key [SSE-S3]
		 - AES-256
		 - No Additional charger
	 - Customer Keys
	 
 - Client Side Encryption
- Creating and Managing Keys
	-
