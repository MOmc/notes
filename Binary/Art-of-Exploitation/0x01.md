# Programming
 - An assembler is one form of machine-language translator—it is a program that translates assembly language into machine-readable code. 
 - A compiler converts a high-level language into machine language. 
 - The GNU development tools include a pro- gram called objdump, which can be used to examine compiled binaries. 
 - `objdump -D a.out | grep -A20 main.:`
	 - `A20` - print 20 lines after the hit 
	 - `-D` - Disassemble
 - The bits of the machine language instructions must be put somewhere, and this somewhere is called memory. Memory is just a collection of bytes of temporary storage space that are numbered with addresses. 
 - The 32-bit processors have 2^32 (or 4,294,967,296) possible addresses, while the 64-bit ones have 2^64 possible addresses. 
 - `0xc3` - `ret`
 - Objdump in Intex flavour
	 - `objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep main.: `
 - Debuggers are used by program- mers to step through compiled programs, examine program memory, and view processor registers. 
 - `gdb -q ./a.out`
 - The EIP register is the Instruction Pointer register, which points to the current instruction the processor is reading not executing.
 - `set disassembly-flavor intel`
 - `operation <destination>, <source> `
 - The destination and source values will either be a register, a memory address, or a value. 
 - The `-g` flag can be used by the GCC compiler to include extra debugging information, which will give GDB access to the source code. 
 - `gdb`
	 - `list` - See the source code
	 - `disassemble main` - disassemble main function	 
- The instructions main are collectively known as the function *prologue* and are generated by the compiler to set up memory for the rest of the `main()` function’s local variables. Part of the reason variables need to be declared in C is to aid the construction of this section of code.
- The GDB debugger provides a direct method to examine memory, using the command `x`, which is short for examine. This command expects two arguments when it’s used: the location in memory to examine and how to display that memory. 
- The debugger lets you reference registers directly, so `$eip` is equivalent to the value EIP contains at that moment. 
- x86 processor values are stored in little-endian byte order, which means the least significant byte is stored first.
