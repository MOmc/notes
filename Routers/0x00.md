 - Routers do use PHP 
 - register_globals is a setting (sometime known as a flag) in your PHP environment. It is typically set in the PHP configuration file known as php.ini file. This setting can have a value of “on” or “off”. An “on” value means that PHP will automatically create global variables for many server variables as well as query string parameters. This is not good and is a security risk.
 - How to check
      - You can put up a temporary PHP page with the phpinfo() function call to display your PHP settings.
  
 - This can allow any user to send a crafted requiest which can chnage the variables in th php code
		- For ex abc.com?Auth=1&Passreq=0

  - hard-coded SSL keys 
  - baked into the firmware
  - LittleBlackBox Project -  It has a database of known default SSL private keys and associates those keys with their corresponding public keys.
  - Router firmware images are mounted readonly
  - source of entropy
    - /dev/random
    - /dev/urandom
  - routers have NVRAM storage for storing configuration data
