**Injection Attacks**

 - *Command Injection*
	 - The child_process core module enables Node developers to invoke underlying OS commands from the application code.
		 - `child_process.exec(command[, options][, callback])`
	 - an attacker can append `;` to break out of the gzip command.
	 - an attacker also can chain multiple commands by using characters such as `;, &, &&, |, ||, $(), <, >, and >>.`
	 - *Prevention*
		 - USE EXECFILE OR SPAWN INSTEAD OF EXEC
			 - When possible, use the child_process module’s execFile or spawn methods instead of exec. Unlike exec, the spawn and execFile method signatures force developers to separate the command and its arguments.
		 - INPUT VALIDATION
			 - USING A WHITELIST APPROACH FOR INPUT VALIDATION
		 	 - USING THE JOI MODULE FOR INPUT VALIDATION
			 - LIMIT USER PRIVILEGES
				 - the Node.js process should not run with root privileges. Instead, run it with a user that has access to only the required resources and no read–write access outside the web application directory.
		 
- *Database Injection*
	 - SQL Injection Attack Mechanics
		 -When malicious data is concatenated to a SQL query, the SQL interpreter fails to distinguish between the intended command and input data, resulting in the execution of the malicious data as SQL commands.
	 	- `admin' -- `
	- *Prevention*
		- USE PARAMETERIZED QUERIES TO BIND ALL USER-SUPPLIED DATA
			- Parameterized queries prevent an attacker from changing the intent of a query, and enable the SQL interpreter to distinguish clearly between code and data. 
		- APPLY INPUT VALIDATIONS BASED ON WHITELIST
		- USE DATABASE ACCOUNTS WITH LEAST PRIVILEGE
			- Consider creating separate users with read-only and read-write access, and choose the user account with the minimum required privileges that meet the requirements.
	- *NoSQL Injection Attack*
		- In MongoDB, the $gt comparison operator selects documents where the value of the field is greater than the specified value. 
		- You can achieve the same results by using another comparison operator, such as $ne, in the input.
		- Another mechanism to manifest NoSQL injection is exploiting the $where operator, which takes a JavaScript function and processes user inputs within the function.
		- The $where operator-based NoSQL injection provides an attacker with the ability to craft malicious inputs using JavaScript language, which offers greater flexibility and options to an attacker when compared to a plain old SQL injection attack, in which strict SQL interpreter rules confine the ways to construct malicious inputs.
	- *Prevention*
		- escape all user-supplied inputs before using it.
		- Avoid using options such as $where with JavaScript functions that directly process user-supplied inputs.

**Broken Authentication and Session Management**

 - *Securing the Authentication Mechanism*
	 - impersonate
	 - The typical attack scenarios include exploiting weak account passwords, passwords stolen from database breaches, active session IDs stolen from a victim user’s browser or network communication, or bugs in password management features such as changing or recovering a forgotten password.
	 - Password cracking is equivalent to a burglar picking the lock on the front door of a house to break in.
	 - Ensure that the change password functionality requires the old password.
	 - The bcrypt algorithm is specifically suitable for encrypting user passwords.It incorporates a salt value by default. It is also a deliberately slow algorithm, thus significantly hampering an attacker’s attempt to compute the hashes for a large number of possible passwords. Moreover, it allows you to control the cost of encryption with a configurable work factor, which you can subsequently increase as computational power increases and hardware costs fall in the future.

 - *Securing Session Management*
	 - Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, to remember a user, the server maintains a session identifier (SID) that is passed back and forth between the client and server. This SID is equivalent to a user’s identity for the server; hence, it also is a primary target for attackers who are trying to impersonate other users.
	 - Session Hijacking Attack
		 - In session hijacking, an attacker steals the session cookie from an active user session and uses it to re-create the session without needing to enter the user ID or password.
		 - An attacker can steal the session cookie using techniques such as utilizing a network sniffer, which is a piece of malicious script injected by using a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or malware installed on a victim’s computer.
		 - Protecting Against Session Hijacking
			 - NEVER INCLUDE THE SID IN A URL PARAMETER
			 - SET HTTPONLY AND SECURE FLAGS ON COOKIE OPTIONS
				 - The httpOnly flag ensures that the cookie is not accessible to JavaScript code running on the browser, foiling the attempts to steal it by using XSS attack. 
				 - The secure flag ensures that the cookie is transmitted only on a secure HTTPS connection, thus eliminating network sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
			 - SET THE SESSION TIMEOUT PERIOD
				 - It is important to limit the lifetime of an active session on the server by using either expires or maxAge cookie options.
				 - Depending on the type of session store used, the default value for session timeout varies. For example, by default, it is one day for connect-redis–based RedisStore, and 14 days for connect-mongo–based MongoStore. Set session timeout to the minimum possible value depending on the context of the application, using maxAge cookie options to set the inactive session timeout.
			 - DESTROY SESSION ON LOGOUT
			 - you should make the logout button plainly visible and easily accessible from all pages that need authentication. Upon logout, destroy active session data by using the destroy method on session; for example, req.session.destroy(). Additionally, invalidate SSO tokens if they are in use.

 - *Session Fixation*
	  - To carry out a session fixation attack, typically an attacker performs these steps:
		  - Obtains a legitimate SID from the server by making an HTTP request; for example, by opening a login page.
		  - Sets the cookie with SID in the victim user’s browser and induces the victim user to use it to authenticate on the target application.
		  - Hijacks the user-validated session with the knowledge of the SID used.
	  - Protecting Against Session Fixation Attack
		  - The key to prevent a session fixation attack is to simply regenerate the SID each time a user authenticates.

**Cross-Site Scripting**

 - The key mechanism behind XSS attack is content injection, wherein an attacker inserts malicious JavaScript content on a web page. 
	 - Reflected XSS is typically a one-to-one attack because an attacker needs to send the malicious link to each user; hence, it affects only those users that click it. So, it has relatively less chances of success as compared to the stored XSS attack
	 - stored XSS is a one-to-many attack with a greater possibility to cause damage.
	 - *Prevention*
	 	- ADD A CONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY HEADER
