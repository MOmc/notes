### [the node js highway attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeCEEW0v8W8&feature=youtu.be)

----------------
 - Two new types of attacks:
    - Regex DoS
    - JSON sqli
  
 - Node JS - Architecture
    - Event Driven arch
    - Single Threaded Event loop 
        - Constantly listening for requests
    - Event Queue
    
    - Ex : Fast food Restraunt:
        - Cashier is a Event Queue (single thread)
        - Cook (Event Handler)
      
    - Pros - NodeJS
        - High I/O intensive applications  
        
    - Cons
        - To solve hard problems
    
    - Some Languages are vulenerable to weak PRNG 
    
    - Nodes uses Google's V8 JS Engine 
        - V8 PRNG is known to be weak
        - You need 3 cracked hashes to calculate he state of fourth one, from there you can find the 4 random no/password
        - Amit kleith
        
    - MEAN stack , NOSQL injection payload
        - ?user[$gt]=a&pass[gt]=a
        
    - REgex DOS 
        - user[$regex:expression]
        - Always validate length ,structure and chracters
